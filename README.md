# Amazon Clone

**Project Summary**:

This is a personal project to highlight my developing skills using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This website is interactive through pure JavaScript and not using another framework for educational purposes. Not all parts of the website are functional and the main pages are the product page and the checkout page.

**What Works**:

On the main product page, there is the ability to add items to cart with the desired quantity. The gif below highlights the functionality of this website.

To highlight the JavaScript aspect, the entire product page was rendered programatically using products found within a JSON dataset. Quantity selection will have no effect until "Add to Cart" is pressed. Once pressed, the information about the product (its product ID and quantity) will be added to a cart object and rendered by the checkout page when the user clicks on it. On the checkout page, the products that the user selected will be rendered on the screen with the ability to update quantity (adding 1 to the quantity each time "update" is clicked), deleting it from the user's cart and having the order summary updated each time the user updates their cart.

The HTML and CSS were templates that were tweaked as the JavaScript code was added, but I have familarity with HTML and CSS enough to tweak the web page as needed.

## Future Updates

- To further improve the code, the code will be split into different classes to better organize and clean up the code. The code is messy for my liking and will be refactored and commented for easier readability.

- Other various improvements that come to mind as I continue to develop this project.
